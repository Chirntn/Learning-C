Compilation of a C Program

These steps are followed to turn a C file into executable:
    1. Preprocessing 
    2. Compilation
    3. Assembly
    4. Linking 

Presprocessing : Comments are removed
                 Macros are expanded
                 #include library contents are transferred to a 
                 separate file (Stored with a file_name.i extension)
                 ex - it copied the contents of stdio.h

Compilation : The file_name.i file is converted to assembly language
              and saved with a file_name.s extension

Assembly : Assembly language is converted to machine level code (.O)

Linking : Takes all .o files and puts them together as an .exe file
          (.out in linux)

          Two types - 
          Static Linking
          Dynamic linking (.dll)
